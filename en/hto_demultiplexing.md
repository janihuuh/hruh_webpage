## HTO Demultiplexing
Seurat's HTODemux often works quite nicely, but in some cases (e.g. when HTOs are expressed in varying intensities) it may not produce optimal results.
Check the lab's github page (scrnaseq/demultiplexing) for a modified and a more flexible version of HTODemux as well as an additional outlier cleanup method.
